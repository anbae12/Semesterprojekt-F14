\section*{Abstract}

This paper describes the development of a pan \& tilt system tracking a clay 
pigeon moving in the air. 
The tracking of the clay pigeon to cartesian coordinates is not included in this 
project. This paper concentrates on making the pan \& tilt system track inputs 
given to the system with a rate of 120 [Hz] of a parabola.
The project (and this paper) is divided into subparts: 
 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Application}
  % - Defining the application, the requirements for 
  %the system and the goals of the project.
  \item \textbf{System identification} 
  %- Identification of the system and it's 
  %corresponding transferfunction. Analysis of the controller needed and the 
  %requirements needed for good performance. Coordinate transformation from
  %cartesian to spherical coordinates.
  \item \textbf{Implementation}
  % - Description of the implementation on the 
  %microcontroller and the FPGA.
  \item \textbf{Tuning of the controller} 
  %- Tuning of the controller to get the 
  %wanted performance.
  \item \textbf{Tests} 
  %- Test of the performance of the pan \& tilt system with 
  %the controller.
  \item \textbf{Discussion} 
  %- Discussion of the project and the performance of 
  % the system.
\end{itemize}

The pan \& tilt system will be uptimized for shooting in English Skeet. For a 1 
radian reference the settling time should be less than 0.557 [s] and a steady 
state error less than 1,78\%.

The systems transferfunctions were obtained by describing the system with a 
mathematical model based on test of a DC motor. The model was......
